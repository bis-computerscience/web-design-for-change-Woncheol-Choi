    <h1>What is the Birth Rate?</h1>
    <p>The birth rate is the ratio between the number of liveborn births in the year and the average total population of that year.</p>

      <h1>The main problem, the birth rate of South Korea</h1>
      <p>The average number of babies a South Korean woman is expected to give birth to during her life fell to 0.72 from 0.78 in 2022, and previous projections estimate that this will fall even further, to 0.68 in 2024. These levels are far below the 2.1 children needed to maintain a country's population at its current level. The decline has been especially concentrated in the capital Seoul, where the 0.55 fertility rate was the lowest in the country. </p>

      <h1>What does low birth rate affect? </h1>
      <p>Beyond the strains on the medical system, low fertility is also threatening South Korea’s economic prosperity and dynamism in the long term by shrinking its workforce and slowing consumption.
        Fewer babies also mean fewer South Korean soldiers, casting a long shadow over national security in a country that faces the threat of provocations from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s 1.2 million-strong army.

      <h1>The factors </h1>
      <p> Diverse factors are blamed for the reluctance among South Koreans to have kids. They range from sky high housing costs to the expensive and highly competitive environment for children’s education. Increasing gender tensions are another reason regularly highlighted.

      <h1>The Possible Solutions</h1>
      <p>So far the government has focused on birthrates. Measures introduced to encourage more births include a tripling of monthly allowances and a reduction of mortgage interest rates for parents. Policymakers are now looking for ways to cope with the aging society, coming to grips with the reality that it would take decades to reverse the demographic trend</p>
